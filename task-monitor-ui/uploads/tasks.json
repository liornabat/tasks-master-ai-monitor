        "description": "Update the case mapping system to use versioned files and track history, ensuring the case_mapping_url is always current and backward compatibility is maintained.",
        "details": "This task involves several key changes across the codebase to support versioned mapping files and history tracking:\n\n1. **Update CaseModel**: Add a new field `case_mapping_history: Optional[List[str]]` to track all historical mapping file URLs. Keep the existing `case_mapping_url` field to point to the most recent mapping file. Ensure proper initialization and migration handling.\n2. **Modify CaseMappingService**: Change `_get_mapping_file_path()` to generate versioned filenames (e.g., `case_mapping_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`). Remove the guard that only sets the URL if it is empty. Always update `case_mapping_url` to point to the new versioned file and append the new URL to `case_mapping_history`.\n3. **Update Classification Workflow**: Modify `_clear_previous_data()` to reset `case_mapping_url` when clearing classifications. Ensure the case model is always saved after mapping operations and add error handling for history updates.\n4. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Create a 'latest' alias by copying the versioned file to `case_mapping.json`. Update any hardcoded references to the static filename.\n5. **Add Utility Methods**: Implement methods to get the latest mapping URL from history, clean up old mapping files (optional retention policy), and validate the history list.\n\n**Code Example (CaseModel update):**\n```python\nclass CaseModel:\n    case_mapping_url: str\n    case_mapping_history: Optional[List[str]] = None\n```\n**Code Example (Versioned filename):**\n```python\ndef _get_mapping_file_path():\n    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')\n    return f'case_mapping_{timestamp}.json'\n```",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Verify case_mapping_url updates**: After each classification run, confirm that `case_mapping_url` points to the new versioned file.\n2. **Check history tracking**: Ensure `case_mapping_history` contains all historical mapping URLs in chronological order.\n3. **Test file existence**: Confirm that both the versioned file and the static `case_mapping.json` file exist and are accessible.\n4. **Validate backward compatibility**: Test that existing consumers can still access mapping data using the static filename.\n5. **Test utility methods**: Verify that utility methods for retrieving the latest URL and cleaning up old files work as expected.\n6. **Error handling**: Ensure proper error handling and validation for history updates and file operations.",

Wrong API Pattern in useCaseMapping Hook:**\n- Currently using direct `fetch()` calls to hardcoded endpoints like `http://localhost:9000/api/cases/test2/mapping`\n- Should use `apiService.request()` with proper `RequestType` enums instead\n- All API calls should go through `/api/request` endpoint with structured request data\n\n### **2. Correct API Pattern (used by other components):**\n- Use `apiService.request<TRequest, TResponse>(RequestType.CASE_MAPPING_*, data)`\n- Structured requests with `{ id, type, data }` format\n- Proper error handling through `ApiError` class\n- Example: `apiService.request(RequestType.CASE_MAPPING_LOAD, { case_id: caseId })`\n\n### **3. TypeScript Errors:**\n- Mutations use `isLoading` property but TanStack Query v5 uses `isPending`\n- `currentUrl` type mismatch in setState (string | undefined vs string)\n\n### **4. Request/Response Types Already Defined:**\n- `CASE_MAPPING_GENERATE`, `CASE_MAPPING_LOAD`, `CASE_MAPPING_CLEAR`, `CASE_MAPPING_UPDATE_URL`\n- Request types: `CaseMappingLoadRequestData`, `CaseMappingGenerateRequestData`, etc.\n- Response types: `CaseMappingLoadResponseData`, `CaseMappingGenerateResponseData`, etc.\n\n### **5. Missing case_mapping_history Field:**\n- Frontend types don't include the `case_mapping_history: string[]` field we added to backend\n- Need to add this to `CasesGetResponseData` and `CaseSummary` interfaces\n\n### **6. Next Steps:**\n- Update useCaseMapping hooks to use apiService.request() pattern\n- Fix TypeScript errors (isLoading → isPending)\n- Add case_mapping_history field to frontend types\n- Implement history viewing UI\n</info added on 2025-07-03T14:22:53.210Z>",

            "details": "- Replace hardcoded endpoint calls with proper job-based API pattern\n- Fix isLoading vs isPending property errors on mutation hooks\n- Fix currentUrl type mismatch in setState function\n- Remove unnecessary code that was added without need\n- Update useCaseMapping hooks to follow correct API patterns\n- Ensure proper error handling and loading states\n<info added on 2025-07-03T14:26:44.854Z>\nSuccessfully fixed API calls and TypeScript errors in CaseMapping.tsx:\n\n1. Added case_mapping_history field to frontend types:\n   - Added to CasesGetResponseData and CaseSummary interfaces\n   - Matches backend model implementation\n\n2. Updated useCaseMapping hook with proper API pattern:\n   - Replaced direct fetch() calls with apiService.request()\n   - Fixed all related hooks (useCaseMapping, useGenerateCaseMapping, etc.)\n   - Added proper RequestType enum imports\n   - Updated for TanStack Query v5 compatibility (changed cacheTime to gcTime)\n\n3. Fixed TypeScript errors:\n   - Corrected mutation loading states (isLoading → isPending)\n   - Resolved currentUrl type issue with null safety\n   - Updated references throughout component\n\n4. Implemented proper API pattern throughout:\n   - All endpoints now use job-based pattern via apiService\n   - Maintained consistent request/response typing\n\n5. Verified all functionality works correctly with no TypeScript errors\n\nReady for implementing case mapping history UI in next subtask.\n</info added on 2025-07-03T14:26:44.854Z>",
